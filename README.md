This is my first project while learning Swift and programming 3D physics.
The app's goal is to recreate the experience you find often in craft beer pubs
with a ring on a string hanging from the ceiling.  You hold the ring back and let it go with a 
bit of a push to try and catch it on a hook on the wall.
